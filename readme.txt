http://catablog.illproductions.com for more information and specifics.

= 0.9.8 =

No Upgrade Notices for CataBlog 0.9.5 and Above.

= 0.9.7 =

Note: This version should be used over 0.9.6 or 0.9.6.1, thanks!

= 0.9.5 =

WARNING: Complete removal of all database manipulation code from CataBlog. This is very good, as all data storage and retrieval will be delegated by built in WordPress functions. To upgrade you will be required to Export and then Import your catalog data. After a successful Import, you may remove the old data from your database in the CataBlog > Options > Systems section . You should leave the images folder alone, as nothing much has changed when it comes to uploads and storage.

= 0.9.3 =

NOTE: Small upgrade here, no really big changes in the database that a few savings of the view templates wouldn't fix anyways.

= 0.9.2 =

NOTE: Use this version over 0.9.1 in all cases they are identical except one line of code that may cause problems with other plugins.

= 0.9.1 =

NOTE: A small upgrade to the code, nothing major.

= 0.9.0 =

NOTE: A column in the database has been renamed because the original label was a reserved mysql keyword. This update was well tested and should not provide any problems, but just incase you should backup your database with the xml export feature before you upgrade. Thanks.
