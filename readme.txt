WARNING: Complete removal of all database manipulation code from CataBlog. This is very good, as all data storage and retrieval will be delegated by built in WordPress functions. To upgrade you will be required to Export and then Import your catalog data. After a successful Import, you may remove the old data from your database in the CataBlog > Options > Systems section . You should leave the images folder alone, as nothing much has changed when it comes to uploads and storage.
